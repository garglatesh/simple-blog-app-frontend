# Simple Blog - Next.js Project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16.x or later)
- **npm** (v7.x or later)

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garglatesh/simple-blog-app-frontend.git
   cd simple-blog-app-frontend
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application, and you can view it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## SSR and Client-Side Components

This project utilizes a hybrid rendering strategy, combining Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering to optimize performance and user experience.

- **SSR Components**:
  - **`app/page.tsx`**: The homepage is rendered on the server to ensure that it loads quickly. This approach is crucial for delivering content quickly to the user, reducing the time to first paint (TTFP), and enhancing search engine optimization (SEO).
  - **`app/post/[id].tsx`**: Individual blog post pages are also rendered on the server. This ensures that readers can access the content quickly and that it is fully indexed by search engines, enhancing the blog's reach and visibility.

- **Client-Side Components**:
  - **`components/post/PostItem.tsx`**: This component is responsible for displaying individual blog post summaries and is rendered on the client side. This allows for interactive features, such as clickable links to full posts.
  - **`components/post/PostList.tsx`**: The list of blog posts is rendered on the client side, enabling dynamic content updates. This could include features like filtering or live updates, enhancing the user experience.



## Unit Testing

This project includes a suite of unit tests built with Jest and React Testing Library. These tests are designed to verify that the components render correctly and behave as expected.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, simply execute:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests will run automatically, providing feedback on whether the components are functioning as intended.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the project, the following enhancements are recommended:

1. **Pagination for Blog Posts**:
   - Implementing pagination will enhance performance and user experience, particularly when the blog grows to include a large number of posts. This will allow users to navigate through content more efficiently.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline will automate testing and ensure that all new code passes the unit tests before it is merged into the main codebase. This will maintain code quality and prevent bugs from being introduced.

3. **Internationalization (i18n)**:
   - Adding support for multiple languages will make the blog accessible to a broader audience, catering to users from different linguistic backgrounds. This will also improve the blog's global reach.

## Conclusion

This project is a foundation for a blog application, effectively balancing SSR and client-side rendering to optimize both performance and interactivity. The inclusion of unit testing ensures that the application is reliable and maintainable. With potential for future enhancements such as pagination, continuous integration, and internationalization, this project is well-positioned for scalability and long-term success.
